  <h1>Simon Frost - Software Engineer</h1>

  <p>https://simonhfrost.com</p>

  <p>https://github.com/simonhfrost</p>

  <p>simonhfrost@gmail.com</p>

  <p>I excel in delivering technical solutions that cater to both users and businesses while improving code quality to reduce future development complexity. I have five years of professional experience as a software engineer in a variety of roles, most recently as a front-end engineer.</p>

  <p>I believe that being a good engineer is more than just writing good code. Communicating effectively, identifying invalid assumptions, and choosing the right tools are all skills I've learned that minimize risk and maximize efficiency.</p>

  <h2>Work Experience</h2>

  <h3> N26</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Banking but better</li>
    <li>Berlin, Germany</li>
    <li>Front-end Developer</li>
    <li>Feb 2016 - Present</li>
    <li>Javascript, Backbone, Sass, Gulp</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At Number26 I improved and maintained a banking application which served over 500,000 views a month.</p>

  <p>There was a strong focus on rapid feature deployment while improving code quality and tooling as the project was taken over from an outsourced contractor. There was also a high focus on design and UX while collaborating with a team of talented designers, product managers and other engineers.</p>

  <p>Features I worked on included a bank switching service, transaction screen redesign, overdraft functionality, premium card ordering, and bank migration. I also achieved more line removals than additions to the project, as a sign of my commitment to improve code quality by minimizing code duplication and introducing best practices.</p>

  <h3>Blacklane</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Your Professional Driver</li>
    <li>Berlin, Germany</li>
    <li>Front-end Developer</li>
    <li>Oct 2014 - Jan 2016</li>
    <li>Javascript, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Gulp, HAML, Sass</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At Blacklane I improved and maintained the second version of a limousine booking application which served over 150,000 views a month.</p>

  <p>Blacklane received Tech5's 'Fastest growing startup in Germany' in 2015, which meant that I was heavily involved in adapting our development methodology as the company grew and transitioned to Scrum. I also evaluated and implemented core technology such as AngularJS, and the introduction of Gulp.</p>

  <p>Features I worked on included a corporate portal, enhancements to the booking form, ride listing improvements, ride ratings, and static marketing/SEO related pages.</p>

  <h3>Telogis</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Route Delivery Optimization and Logistics</li>
    <li>Christchurch, New Zealand</li>
    <li>Full stack developer</li>
    <li>Feb 2012 - Feb 2014</li>
    <li>Javascript, C#, SQL, PowerShell</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At Telogis I worked on the interface and backend for a traveling salesman problem solver. The product was used by numerous large American companies such as Coca-cola and Verizon.</p>

  <p>The product was mathematically technical in nature and I worked alongside many talented PhD and Masters degree graduates. Working as a full stack developer as my first position outside of University was great exposure to a range of different technologies.</p>

  <p>Features I worked on included a route templating system, routing algorithm memory optimziations, user creation and modification tooling, and testing improvements such as the introduction of BDD.</p>

  <h3>HITLab</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Effective Design Processes for Educational Computer Games</li>
    <li>University of Canterbury, New Zealand</li>
    <li>Game Developer</li>
    <li>Nov 2011 - Feb 2012</li>
    <li>Javascript, C#, Unity3D</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At the HITLab (Human Interface and Technology Laboratory) I obtained a scholarship and worked with a PhD student to develop a prototype game that taught players the application and methods of harnessing geothermal energy.

  <p>The focus of the project was to identify aspects that enhance learning such as the concept of 'flow' which is a state between being overwhelmed and underwhelmed and consequently feeling engaged to learn. The game won an internationally recognized student award, more information can be found here: [[link]](http://www.comsdev.canterbury.ac.nz/rss/news/?feed=news&articleId=443)

  <p>Features I worked on included the initial creation of the project, scripting with objects and NPCs, environment creation, and sequencing of models and animations.
