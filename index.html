  <p>I have over twelve years experience building frontend web and mobile products and features. I focus not only on merging code, but also on improving processes and communication in multidisciplinary tech teams that help improve code and organizational health.</p>

  <p>I have experience at early stage startups such as Berlin based unicorn N26, and Blacklane which was named Germany's fastest growing startup by Tech5 in 2015. I also have experience at international corporations such as SAP and Verizon Connect.</p>

  <p>Being a good frontend engineer is more than just writing good code. Communicating effectively, identifying invalid assumptions, and choosing the right tools are all essential skills I've learned that minimize risk and maximize efficiency.</p>
