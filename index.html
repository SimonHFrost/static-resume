  <p>I have over seven years of experience excelling in building frontend web features and products. I also take care of technical decisions that effect maintainability and future development complexity.</p>

  <p>My experience ranges from small startups (Blacklane, N26) to fully established corporations (SAP, Telogis), and have recently started working on a project basis as a freelancer in Berlin.</p>

  <p>Being a good frontend engineer is more than just writing good code. Communicating effectively, identifying invalid assumptions, and choosing the right tools are all essential skills I've learned that minimize risk and maximize efficiency.</p>

  <h2>Work Experience</h2>

  <h3>SAP (freelancer)</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>April 2018 - October 2018 (6 months)</li>
    <li>Berlin, Germany</li>
    <li>Frontend Engineer - <i>Javascript, Vue.js, Vue-cli, CSS3, AWS, Invision</i></li>
  </ul>

  <p>At SAP I created a prototype for a universal identification system for both internal and external company use.</p>

  <p>Features I completed included account creation, account linking, and account login.</p>

  <h3>Planet (freelancer)</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Feb 2017 - Nov 2017 (9 months)</li>
    <li>Berlin, Germany</li>
    <li>Frontend Engineer - <i>Javascript, React, Redux, Webpack, Material-UI</i></li>
  </ul>

  <p>At Planet I improved and maintained the frontend of an administration tool that managed imagery captured daily by more than hundred micro satellites.</p>

  <p>Features I completed included access management tooling, report viewing, report generation, and implementing two factor authentication.</p>

  <h3>N26</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Feb 2016 - Nov 2016 (9 months)</li>
    <li>Berlin, Germany</li>
    <li>Frontend Engineer - <i>Javascript, Backbone.js, SASS, Gulp, Zeplin</i></li>
  </ul>

  <p>At N26 I improved and maintained a banking application which served over 500,000 views a month.</p>

  <p>Features I completed included a transaction screen redesign, overdraft functionality, premium card ordering, and migration to the new licenced bank.</p>

  <p>There was a strong focus on rapid feature deployment while improving code quality and tooling as the project was taken over from a contractor. There was also a high focus on design and UX while collaborating with a team of talented designers. I removed more lines than added in the codebase, as a sign of my commitment to improve code quality by minimizing code duplication and introducing best practices.</p>

  <h3>Blacklane</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Oct 2014 - Feb 2016 (1 year 4 months)</li>
    <li>Berlin, Germany</li>
    <li>Frontend Engineer - <i>Javascript, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Gulp, HAML, SASS</i></li>
  </ul>

  <p>At Blacklane I improved and maintained the second version of a limousine booking application which served over 30,000 views a month.</p>

  <p>Features I completed included a corporate portal, enhancements to the booking form, ride listing improvements, ride ratings, and static marketing/SEO related pages.</p>

  <p>Blacklane received Tech5's 'Fastest growing startup in Germany' in 2015, which meant that I was heavily involved in adapting our development methodology as the company grew and transitioned to Scrum. I also evaluated and implemented core technologies such as AngularJS, and the introduction of Gulp.</p>

  <h3>Telogis</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Feb 2012 - Feb 2014 (2 years)</li>
    <li>Christchurch, New Zealand</li>
    <li>Full stack Engineer - <i>Javascript, C#, SQL, PowerShell</i></li>
  </ul>

  <p>At Telogis I improved and maintained the interface and backend for a traveling salesman problem solver. The product was used by numerous large American companies such as Coca-Cola and Ford, and has since been acquired by Verizon.</p>

  <h3>HITLab</h3>

    <li>Nov 2011 - Feb 2012 (3 months)</li>
    <li>University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand</li>
    <li>Game Developer - <i>Javascript, C#, Unity3D</i></li>

  <p>At the HITLab (Human Interface and Technology Laboratory) I obtained a scholarship and worked with a PhD student to develop a prototype game that taught players the application and methods of harnessing geothermal energy.
