  <p>I excel in delivering technical solutions that cater to users while improving code quality to reduce future development complexity. I have over five years of professional experience as a software engineer, most recently as a front-end engineer.</p>

  <p>Being a good software engineer is more than just writing good code. Communicating effectively, identifying invalid assumptions, and choosing the right tools are all essential skills I've learned that minimize risk and maximize efficiency.</p>

  <h2>Work Experience</h2>

  <h3>N26</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Feb 2016 - Present</li>
    <li>Berlin, Germany</li>
    <li>Banking but better</li>
    <li>Front-end Developer</li>
    <li>Javascript, Backbone, SCSS, Gulp</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At Number26 I improved and maintained a banking application which served over 500,000 views a month.</p>

  <p>There was a strong focus on rapid feature deployment while improving code quality and tooling as the project was taken over from a contractor. There was also a high focus on design and UX while collaborating with a team of talented designers, product managers and other engineers. I removed more lines than added in the codebase, as a sign of my commitment to improve code quality by minimizing code duplication and introducing best practices.</p>

  <p>Features I worked on included a bank switching service, transaction screen redesign, overdraft functionality, premium card ordering, and bank migration.</p>

  <h3>Blacklane</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Oct 2014 - Jan 2016</li>
    <li>Berlin, Germany</li>
    <li>Your Professional Driver</li>
    <li>Front-end Developer</li>
    <li>Javascript, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Gulp, HAML, SASS</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At Blacklane I improved and maintained the second version of a limousine booking application which served over 30,000 views a month.</p>

  <p>Blacklane received Tech5's 'Fastest growing startup in Germany' in 2015, which meant that I was heavily involved in adapting our development methodology as the company grew and transitioned to Scrum. I also evaluated and implemented core technologies such as AngularJS, and the introduction of Gulp.</p>

  <p>Features I worked on included a corporate portal, enhancements to the booking form, ride listing improvements, ride ratings, and static marketing/SEO related pages.</p>

  <h3>Telogis</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Feb 2012 - Feb 2014</li>
    <li>Christchurch, New Zealand</li>
    <li>Route Delivery Optimization and Logistics</li>
    <li>Full stack developer</li>
    <li>Javascript, C#, SQL, PowerShell</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At Telogis I worked on the interface and backend for a traveling salesman problem solver. The product was used by numerous large American companies such as Coca-cola and Ford, and has since been acquired by Verizon.</p>

  <p>The product was mathematically technical so I worked alongside talented PhD and Masters graduates. Working as a full stack developer as my first position outside of University was great exposure to a range of different technologies.</p>

  <p>Features I worked on included a route templating system, routing algorithm memory optimziations, user creation and modification tooling, and testing improvements such as the introduction of BDD.</p>

  <h3>HITLab</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Nov 2011 - Feb 2012</li>
    <li>University of Canterbury, New Zealand</li>
    <li>Effective Design Processes for Educational Computer Games</li>
    <li>Game Developer</li>
    <li>Javascript, C#, Unity3D</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At the HITLab (Human Interface and Technology Laboratory) I obtained a scholarship and worked with a PhD student to develop a prototype game that taught players the application and methods of harnessing geothermal energy.

  <p>The focus of the project was to identify aspects that enhance learning such as the concept of 'flow' which is a state between being overwhelmed and underwhelmed and consequently feeling engaged to learn. The game won an internationally recognized student award, more information can be found here: <a href="http://www.comsdev.canterbury.ac.nz/rss/news/?feed=news&articleId=443">[Link]</a>

  <p>Features I worked on included the initial creation of the project, scripting with objects and NPCs, environment creation, and sequencing of models and animations.
