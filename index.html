  <p>With over ten years experience building and coordinating teams around frontend web features and products, I have a focus not only on merging pull (merge) requests, but also on improving processes within the team.</p>
    
  <p>I have been integral at the early stage of startups such as N26, current unicorn valued at $3.5 billion. As well as Blacklane, named Germany's fastest growing startup by Tech5 in 2015. I also have experience at established corporations such as SAP and Telogis (now named Verizon Connect).</p>

  <p>Being a good frontend engineer is more than just writing good code. Communicating effectively, identifying invalid assumptions, and choosing the right tools are all essential skills I've learned that minimize risk and maximize technological efficiency.</p>
