  <p>I have over seven years experience excelling in building frontend web features and products. I also take care of technical decisions that effect maintainability and future development complexity.</p>

  <p>My experience ranges from startups (N26, Blacklane) to fully established corporations (SAP, Telogis), and am currently working on a project basis as a freelancer in Berlin.</p>

  <p>Being a good frontend engineer is more than just writing good code. Communicating effectively, identifying invalid assumptions, and choosing the right tools are all essential skills I've learned that minimize risk and maximize efficiency.</p>

    <li>Frontend Engineer - <i>Backbone.js, SASS, Gulp, Zeplin, Javascript</i></li>
  </ul>

  <p>N26 offers mobile banking solutions to customers in the European Union (and recently worldwide).</p>

  <p>At N26 I improved and maintained a banking application which served over 500,000 views a month. There was a strong focus on rapid feature deployment while improving code quality and tooling as the project was taken over from a contractor. There was also a high focus on design and UX while collaborating with a team of talented designers. I removed more lines than added in the codebase, as a sign of my commitment to improve code quality by minimizing code duplication and introducing best practices. Features I completed included a transaction screen redesign, overdraft functionality, premium card ordering, and migration to the new licenced bank.</p>

  <h3>Blacklane</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Oct 2014 - Feb 2016 (1 year 4 months)</li>

    <li>Frontend Engineer - <i>AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Gulp, HAML, SASS, Javascript</i></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Blacklane is a global chauffeur and airport concierge service.</p>

  <p>At Blacklane I improved and maintained the second version of a limousine booking application which served over 30,000 views a month. Blacklane received Tech5's 'Fastest growing startup in Germany' in 2015, which meant that I was heavily involved in adapting our development methodology as the company grew and transitioned to Scrum. I also evaluated and implemented core technologies such as AngularJS, and the introduction of Gulp. Features I completed included a corporate portal, enhancements to the booking form, ride listing improvements, ride ratings, and static marketing/SEO related pages.</p>

  </ul>

  <p>At Telogis I improved and maintained the interface and backend for a traveling salesman problem solver.</p>

  <p>The product was used by numerous large American companies such as Coca-Cola and Ford, and has since been acquired by Verizon. The product was mathematically complex so I worked alongside talented PhD and Masters graduates. Working as a full stack developer as my first position outside of University was great exposure to a range of different technologies and disciplines. Features I worked on included a route templating system, routing algorithm memory optimizations, user modification tooling, and testing improvements such as the introduction of BDD.</p>

  <h3>HITLab</h3>

    <li>Nov 2011 - Feb 2012 (3 months)</li>
