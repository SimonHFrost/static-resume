  <p>I excel in delivering technical solutions that cater to users while improving code quality to reduce future development complexity. I have over five years of professional experience as a software engineer, most recently as a front-end engineer.</p>

  <p>Being a good software engineer is more than just writing good code. Communicating effectively, identifying invalid assumptions, and choosing the right tools are all essential skills I've learned that minimize risk and maximize efficiency.</p>

  <h2>Work Experience</h2>

  <h3>Planet (freelancer)</h3>

  <b>Feb 2017 - Now</b>

  <p>At Planet I improved and maintained an administration tool that managed imagery captured by more than hundred micro satellites that image the earth daily. Features I worked on included access management tooling, report viewing and generation, and implementing two factor authentication.</p>

  <h3>N26</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Feb 2016 - Nov 2016 (9 months)</li>
    <li>Berlin, Germany</li>
    <li>Front-end Developer</li>
    <li>Javascript, Backbone, SASS, Gulp</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At Number26 I improved and maintained a banking application which served over 500,000 views a month.</p>

  <p>Features I worked on included a transaction screen redesign, overdraft functionality, premium card ordering, and migration to the new licenced bank.</p>

  <p>There was a strong focus on rapid feature deployment while improving code quality and tooling as the project was taken over from a contractor. There was also a high focus on design and UX while collaborating with a team of talented designers, product managers and other engineers. I removed more lines than added in the codebase, as a sign of my commitment to improve code quality by minimizing code duplication and introducing best practices.</p>

  <h3>Blacklane</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Oct 2014 - Feb 2016 (1 year 4 months)</li>
    <li>Berlin, Germany</li>
    <li>Front-end Developer</li>
    <li>Javascript, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Gulp, HAML, SASS</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At Blacklane I improved and maintained the second version of a limousine booking application which served over 30,000 views a month.</p>

  <p>Features I worked on included a corporate portal, enhancements to the booking form, ride listing improvements, ride ratings, and static marketing/SEO related pages.</p>

  <p>Blacklane received Tech5's 'Fastest growing startup in Germany' in 2015, which meant that I was heavily involved in adapting our development methodology as the company grew and transitioned to Scrum. I also evaluated and implemented core technologies such as AngularJS, and the introduction of Gulp.</p>

  <h3>Telogis</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Feb 2012 - Feb 2014 (2 years)</li>
    <li>Christchurch, New Zealand</li>
    <li>Full-stack Developer</li>
    <li>Javascript, C#, SQL, PowerShell</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At Telogis I improved and maintained the interface and backend for a traveling salesman problem solver. The product was used by numerous large American companies such as Coca-cola and Ford, and has since been acquired by Verizon.</p>

  <p>Features I worked on included a route templating system, routing algorithm memory optimziations, user modification tooling, and testing improvements such as the introduction of BDD.</p>

  <p>The product was mathematically technical so I worked alongside talented PhD and Masters graduates. Working as a full stack developer as my first position outside of University was great exposure to a range of different technologies and disciplines.</p>

  <h3>HITLab</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Nov 2011 - Feb 2012 (3 months)</li>
    <li>University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand</li>
    <li>Game Developer</li>
    <li>Javascript, C#, Unity3D</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At the HITLab (Human Interface and Technology Laboratory) I obtained a scholarship and worked with a PhD student to develop a prototype game that taught players the application and methods of harnessing geothermal energy.

  <p>Features I worked on included the initial creation of the project, scripting with objects and NPCs, environment creation, and sequencing of models and animations.

  <p>The focus of the project was to identify aspects that enhance learning such as the concept of 'flow' which is a state between being overwhelmed and underwhelmed and consequently feeling engaged to learn. The game won an internationally recognized student award.</a>

  <h2>Personal Projects</h2>

  <h3>Mixing Mustard</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/simonhfrost/midi-yo">github.com/simonhfrost/midi-yo</a></li>
    <li>ES6 midi, audio, and visualizer app</li>
    <p>In order to strengthen my JavaScript skills I created a project that interfaced with the Web Midi API and my hardware 'Launchpad' device. This is an ongoing project with the goal of controlling both the visuals from WebGL, and music from a separate application simultaneously.</p>
  </ul>

  <h3>Awkward Turtle</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=awkwardturtle.frostapplications">play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=awkwardturtle.frostapplications</a>
    <li>Android 'interesting fact' application with 15,000+ downloads</li>
    <p>After leaving university I wanted to make a practical Android application instead of the theoretical work I'd been doing in class. I learned a lot about advertisment platforms, analytics, and collaboring with a designer I met from Canada.</p>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Certified Organic, Vegan Sequetron 5000</h3>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/ashokfernandez/MidiHack2015">github.com/ashokfernandez/MidiHack2015</a></li>
    <li>Basic step sequencer in iOS for 'Midihack' Hackathon</li>
    <p>I created my first iOS application with a friend in order to learn a new technology. I find hackathons great for learning as they force me to move fast and be efficient under the short time pressure.<p>
  </ul>
